I am a 22 years old student who is passionate about human, science and sport! After high-school, I studied two years in a preparatory class in Bordeaux (CPBx), in sport study program in volley-ball. I currently play at a national level in Talence. Next, I joined an engineering school named ENSC (Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure de Cognitique). Cognitique is a french word designating the association between cognitive and computer sciences. This concept includes artificial intelligence, human-machine interaction, user experience (UX), but also other fields of human and social sciences (human factor, neurosciences, psychology...). One of the main reasons of this choice is a neuroscience project that I have been worfking on during High-School with a neuroscientist. This really motivated me to work in a field related to cognitive sciences in the future. 

After discovering artificial intelligence and Data Science in my exchange semester in Canada, at Laval University, I've decided to explore these fields deeper during my last year of engineering school, at the ENSEIRB MATMECA. I study machine learning and Data Science, deep learning, but also reinforcement learning, knowledge representation and research algorithms.

 I am currently looking for an intership related to these fields for february year 2023.
