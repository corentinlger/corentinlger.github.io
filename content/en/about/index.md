I am a 22 years old student in the engineering school ENSC (Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure de Cognitique) . Cognitique is a french word designating the association between cognitive and computer sciences. It includes artificial intelligence, human-machine interaction, UX, but also human and social sciences. I am passionate about human, problem solving and technologies, and that is why i chose this field of study. 

After discovering AI and data science in my exchange semestre in Canada, at Laval University, I've decided to specialize in these fields for my last year in engineering school, at the ENSEIRB MATMECA.

 I am currently looking for an intership in this field for year 2023. Don't hesitate to contact me on my social medias if it interests you !
