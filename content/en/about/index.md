I'm a 23-year-old student passionate about humans, science, sports, and learning new things. I integrated ENSC, a French engineering school focused on the association between cognitive and computer sciences, including AI, human-machine interaction, and UX. My interest in cognitive sciences was sparked by a high school project supervised by a neuroscience researcher and further fueled by a memoir on 'Stress and Addiction' during preparatory class.

During an exchange semester in Canada, I discovered artificial intelligence and data science, which led me to delve deeper into these fields by doing a data science internship and then my final year at ENSEIRB MATMECA. Working with Inria researchers, I explored the combination of reinforcement learning and symbolic AI.

Now, I'm pursuing a Deep Reinforcement Learning research internship at Inria between Flowers and Mnemosyne teams. My research theme is currently "evolving Reservoirs for Meta-Reinforcement Learning".
