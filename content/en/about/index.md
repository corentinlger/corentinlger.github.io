I am a 23-year-old student who is passionate about humans, science, and sports, as well as learning new things in general. After two years in a preparatory class in a volleyball sport study program, I integrated a French engineering school named ENSC (Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure de Cognitique). 'Cognitique' is a French word that encompasses the association between cognitive and computer sciences. This concept includes artificial intelligence, human-machine interaction, user experience (UX), and other fields of human and social sciences, such as the human factor, neurosciences, and psychology.

One of the main reasons for this choice was a project supervised by a neuroscience researcher in high school. Later, during preparatory class, a memoir I wrote with a classmate on 'Stress and Addiction' confirmed my passion and motivated me even more to work in a field related to cognitive sciences in the future.

After discovering artificial intelligence and data science during my exchange semester in Canada, at Laval University, I decided to delve deeper into these fields during my final year of engineering school at the ENSEIRB MATMECA. Throughout the semester, I had the opportunity to work with Inria researchers on a project that combined reinforcement learning and symbolic AI.

This led me to my current machine learning research internship at Inria, where I am working between two teams studying artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences. My goal is to explore the field of Meta-Reinforcement Learning with more biologically plausible algorithms, such as Reservoirs.

Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in working on projects, especially research projects, related to reinforcement learning or any of the other fields I mentioned above!
