This data science project aims to identify what emotion a person is feeling on a picture. Here, we especially focus on depressed or happy people. In order to do so, pictures were downloaded from the web thanks to a data pipeline and have then been pre-processed. Then, a machine learning model has been created with the Tensorflow package to learn our artificial intelligence what people look like depending on their emotions. The model has finally been evaluated, and tested on other random images and gave excellent results.
