This is the first big data (and data science) project I ever made, during my scholarship in Canada. The goal of this project is to predict the vote of canadian citizens during the 2019 election, thanks to responses to a survey. <p>

Despite the fact that we were beginners in this field,we managed with my classmate to predict about 80% of those votes right. <p>
