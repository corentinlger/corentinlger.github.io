title: "Spaceship Titanic"
---

This is a kaggle data science project wich aims to discover who was in the 'Spaceship Titanic', an interstellar passenger liner. We used an ensemble learning algorithm to achieve this goal : a random forest. After a step of pre-processing with missing values prediction (with a KNN algotithm for numerical values), our machine learning model was able to identify wether a person was in the ship or not with an accuracy of about 80%.
