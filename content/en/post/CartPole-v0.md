title: "CartPole-v0 Reinforcement learning"
---

A classical reinforcement learning project on the gym environment CartPole-V0. The agent is the cart, controlled by two possible actions +1, -1 pointing on moving left or right. Our goal is to maintain this cart as straight as possible. To do so, we developped two reinforcement learning models, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) methods.
