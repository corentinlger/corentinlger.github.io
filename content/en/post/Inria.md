title: "Internship - Meta Reinforcement Learning with evolving Reservoirs"
---

After gaining initial experience in Reinforcement Learning research during a semester project, I decided to further pursue this field through a 6-month internship at Inria, working between teams Flowers and Mnemosyne. My current focus is on studying the evolutionary-scale development of neural structures, such as Reservoirs. The objective is to enhance the adaptability of RL agents equipped with these structures to their environments at a developmental scale
