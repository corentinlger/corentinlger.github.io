title: "Graph Traversal"
---

This is our first artificial intellligence project with two classmates at the ENSC. The goal was to use graph traversal algorithms such as Diksjtra or A* to find the shortest path to a location on a map. In order to do so, we had to adapt to each environment to find appropriate heuristics and improve our algorithms.
