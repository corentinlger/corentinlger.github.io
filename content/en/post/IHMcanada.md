title: "Human-machine interface for Ice cream shop"
---

This UX project was realized with 5 other classmates in Canada. We had to create a brand new human machine interface for an ice cream shop and answer to specific needs. In order to do so, we had to contact potential customers but also people working in this fiel, and interview them based on UX methods. When we fully understood the needs of the future interface users, we started to create wireframes. Then we used random people to test our interface, and this permitted to confirm some of our choices and improve some others !
