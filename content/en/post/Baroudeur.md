title: "Conception of a mobile application 'Baroudeurs'"
---

This is a transdisciplinary project that ended up with the creation of a mobile application called “Baroudeurs”. The goal is to help people discover cities in a innovative manner. We worked on the conception of the application with UX methods, and also programmed the back-end part of Baroudeurs. Another group was in charge of the coding of the apllication.
