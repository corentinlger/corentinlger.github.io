title: "Genetic Algorithm for sport's pools optimization"
---

Being a volleyball player and taking the road several times a month, to play against other teams in distant cities, I wondered how sport pools were optimized in order to have more reasonable and equivalent travel times for the teams of a same category. 

To get a better understanding of how I could improve the current distribution of cities in sport pools and learn more about evolutionnary algorithms, I created a custom genetic algorithm from scratch only using NumPy. It is integrated in a python class, and you can use easiely use it by only providing another list of cities to allocate in pools ! An example of use is provided in a jupyter-notebook file.
