title: "Alzheimer disease detection by 3D MRI analysis "
---


This project focuses on medical imaging and computer vision. The goal is to develop a method (a machine learning with 2D or 3D convolutions) in order to detect the state of development of Alzheimer disease thanks 3D MRI scans of humain brain. 

- Team size : 4 persons
- Project lenght : 1 month
