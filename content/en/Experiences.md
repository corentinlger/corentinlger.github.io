## Deep Reinforcement Learning Research Intern
**Inria - Flowers & Mnemosyne teams**\
Bordeaux, France\
03-2023 - 09-2023

- We study how neural structures, such as Reservoirs, can adapt at an evolutionary-scale for Reinforcement Learning problems. The objective is to enhance the adaptability of RL agents equipped with these structures to their environments at a developmental scale. We tested if our architecture can help solving partially observable tasks, but also 3D motor tasks and finally if evolved Reservoirs can generalize and adapt ton new unseen environments.



## Data Science Intern
**Connectiv-IT**\
Bordeaux, France\
05-2022 - 08-2022

- I worked on the optimization of the maintenance of an aircraft fleet. I realized several data science tasks such as data processing and visualization, but also statistical analysis and clustering with unsupervised learning. Two models of outlier detection and missing value simulation were also created, as well as a theoretical linear programming optimization model.
