### Deep Reinforcement Learning Research Intern
**Inria - Flowers & Mnemosyne teams**\
Bordeaux, France\
03-2023 - 09-2023

- I was involved in a research project named "Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement-Learning". With researchers, we studied how neural structures could adapt at an evolutionary scale, in order to enhance the adaptability of RL agents to their environment at a developmental scale. We tested if our method can help solving partially observable tasks, complex 3D motors tasks and finally, if evolved neural structures could generalize and enable agents to adapt to unseen environments.
- We are currently writing a scientific paper to present our work.


### Data Science Intern
**Connectiv-IT**\
Bordeaux, France\
05-2022 - 08-2022

- I worked on the optimization of the maintenance of an aircraft fleet. I realized several data science tasks such as data processing and visualization, but also statistical analysis and clustering with unsupervised learning. Two models of outlier detection and missing value simulation were also created, as well as a theoretical linear programming optimization model.
