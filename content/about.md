Hi, I'm Corentin, an AI Research Engineer with a focus on Reinforcement Learning, LLMs, and Software Engineering. I'm interested in the intersection of human sciences, evolution, and AI, and currently work in the [Inria Flowers](https://flowers.inria.fr/) team, where I develop and study multi-agent systems. This involves building software to understand the evolution of texts generated by populations of LLMs, and developing a multi-agent simulator in Jax for research and teaching in AI.

I hold a Master's degree in Cognitive and Computer Sciences from ENSC (GPA 4.0), complemented by exchange programs at Laval University (Canada) and ENSEIRB MATMECA, in AI and Data Science. I also interned at [Connectiv-IT](http://www.connectiv-it.com/) as a Data Scientist, and at [Inria](https://inria.fr/fr) between [Flowers](https://flowers.inria.fr/) and [Mnemosyne](https://team.inria.fr/mnemosyne/) teams, where I conducted research on Meta Reinforcement Learning, Recurrent Neural Networks and Evolutionary Algorithms.

Among a lot of other things, I also love sport, and play volley-ball at a national level. [Our team](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FhwyMhKOxN7QKWM3JcCXx-rfS5ZLsxHw/view?usp=sharing) in Bordeaux placed 3rd in the 2023 French University Championship !
