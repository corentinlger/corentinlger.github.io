Hi, I'm Corentin, an AI Research Engineer with a focus on Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Computation, and Software Engineering. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of cognitive sciences, evolution, and AI.

I graduated from ENSC, a French engineering school specializing in cognitive and computer sciences. During my studies, I pursued an exchange semester in Laval University (Canada) in artificial intelligence and data science. It led me to do a 4 months data science internship at [Connectiv-IT](http://www.connectiv-it.com/). Subsequently, I completed another exchange at ENSEIRB MATMECA to specialize in AI, where I got my first research experience. we explored the use of Reinforcement Learning with symbolic AI in collaboration with Inria researchers. After that, I started a research internship in the [Flowers team at Inria](https://flowers.inria.fr/), where I explored the combination of Meta Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Algorithms, and Reservoir Computing.

Curently, I am a Research Engineer in the Flowers team, where I work on various projects, including the development of a multi-agent simulator and the study of cultural evolution in populations of LLMs. 

Among a lot of other things, I also love sport, and play volley-ball at a national level.
