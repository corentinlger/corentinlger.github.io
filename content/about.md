Hello I'm Corentin, an AI research engineer particularly interested in Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Cognitive Sciences. I graduated from ENSC, a French engineering school focused on the synergy between cognitive and computer sciences. My interest in these fields was originally sparked by a high school project supervised by a neuroscience researcher.

During this school, my curiosity led me to do an exchange semester in Canada, where I discovered with more depth artificial intelligence and data science, and decided to do a data science internship the same year. I did another exchange the next semester at ENSEIRB MATMECA to specialize in artificial intelligence, which allowed me to get my first research experience. This project aimed to explore the association of Reinforcement Learning and symbolic AI with Inria PhDs and researchers.

Iâ€™m now a research intern at Inria between Flowers and Mnemosyne teams, where I study the combination of meta Reinforcement Learning, evolutionary algorithms and Reservoir Computing.

Among a lot of other things, I also love sport, and play volley-ball at a national level.
