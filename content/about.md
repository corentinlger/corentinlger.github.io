Hi, I'm Corentin, an AI Research Engineer with a keen interest in the intersection of cognitive sciences, evolution and artificial intelligence. My core focus centers on Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Evolutionary  Computation. 

I graduated from ENSC, a French engineering school specializing in cognitive and computer sciences. During my studies, I pursued an exchange semester in Canada, delving deeper into artificial intelligence and data science. It led me to do a 4 months data science internship at Connectiv-IT. Subsequently, I completed another exchange at ENSEIRB MATMECA to specialize in AI, gaining valuable research experience exploring Reinforcement Learning and symbolic AI in collaboration with Inria researchers. After that, I became a research intern at Inria, where I explored the combination of Meta Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Algorithms, and Reservoir Computing.

Curently, I am a Research Engineer at Inria in the Flowers team, where I develop a a large scale multi-agents simulator for research and teaching in Artificial Intelligence / Artificial Life. 

Among a lot of other things, I also love sport, and play volley-ball at a national level.
