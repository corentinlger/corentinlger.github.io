Hi, I'm Corentin, an AI Research Engineer in the [Inria Flowers](https://flowers.inria.fr/) team. I have strong foundation in Machine Learning and Software Development, and I'm particularly interested in Reinforcement Learning, LLMs and Evolutionary Strategies. Currently I develop and study multi-agent systems, which involves building software to analyze text evolution in populations of LLMs and creating a multi-agent simulator in Jax.

I hold a Master's degree in Cognitive and Computer Sciences from ENSC (GPA 4.0), complemented by exchange programs in AI. I also interned at [Connectiv-IT](http://www.connectiv-it.com/) as a Data Scientist, and at [Inria](https://inria.fr/fr) between [Flowers](https://flowers.inria.fr/) and [Mnemosyne](https://team.inria.fr/mnemosyne/) teams, where I conducted research on Reinforcement Learning, RNNs and Evolutionary Strategies.

Among a lot of other things, I love sport and play volley-ball at a national level. [Our team](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FhwyMhKOxN7QKWM3JcCXx-rfS5ZLsxHw/view?usp=sharing) in Bordeaux placed 3rd in the 2023 French University Championship !
