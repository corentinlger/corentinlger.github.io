Hi, I'm Corentin LÃ©ger, an AI Research Engineer with a focus on Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, LLMs, and Software Engineering. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of human sciences, evolution, and AI.

I hold a Master's degree in Cognitive and Computer Sciences from [ENSC](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr), complemented by exchange programs at [Laval University](https://www.ulaval.ca/) (Canada) and [ENSEIRB MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr), where I focused on AI and Data Science. I also held internships at [Connectiv-IT](http://www.connectiv-it.com/) in Data Science, and at [Inria](https://inria.fr/fr) between [Flowers](https://flowers.inria.fr/) and [Mnemosyne](https://team.inria.fr/mnemosyne/) teams, where I explored the combination of Meta Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Algorithms, and Reservoir Computing.

Currently, as a Research Engineer with the Flowers team, I work on developping and studying multi-agent systems. This involves building a particle-world simulator in Jax, and studying how texts generated by LLM networks evolve over time. 

Among a lot of other things, I also love sport, and play volley-ball at a national level. Our team in Bordeaux placed [3rd in the 2023 French University Championship](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FhwyMhKOxN7QKWM3JcCXx-rfS5ZLsxHw/view?usp=sharing) !
