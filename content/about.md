Hi, I'm Corentin, an AI Research Engineer interested in the intersection between cognitive sciences, evolution and artificial intelligence. My core focus centers on Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Computation and Software Engineering. 

I graduated from ENSC, a French engineering school specializing in cognitive and computer sciences. During my studies, I pursued an exchange semester in Canada, delving deeper into artificial intelligence and data science. It led me to do a 4 months data science internship at [Connectiv-IT](http://www.connectiv-it.com/). Subsequently, I completed another exchange at ENSEIRB MATMECA to specialize in AI, where I got my first research experience by exploring Reinforcement Learning and symbolic AI in collaboration with Inria researchers. After that, I started a research internship in the [Flowers team at Inria](https://flowers.inria.fr/), where I explored the combination of Meta Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Algorithms, and Reservoir Computing.

Curently, I am a Research Engineer in the Flowers team, where I work on various projects, such as developping a multi-agents simulator or studying cultural evolution in populations of LLMs. 

Among a lot of other things, I also love sport, and play volley-ball at a national level.
