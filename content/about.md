Hi, I'm Corentin, an AI Research Engineer specializing in Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Computation, and Software Engineering. I'm passionate about the intersection of human sciences, evolution, and AI.

I graduated from [ENSC](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr), a French engineering school specializing in cognitive and computer sciences. During my studies, I completed exchange programs at [Laval University](https://www.ulaval.ca/) (Canada) and [ENSEIRB MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr), focusing on AI and Data Science. I also held internships at [Connectiv-IT](http://www.connectiv-it.com/) in Data Science, and at [Inria](https://inria.fr/fr) between [Flowers](https://flowers.inria.fr/) and [Mnemosyne](https://team.inria.fr/mnemosyne/) teams, where I explored the combination of Meta Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Algorithms, and Reservoir Computing.

Curently, I am working in the Flowers team as a Research Engineer, developing a multi-agents simulator in Jax and studying cultural evolution in populations of LLMs. 

Among a lot of other things, I also love sport, and play volley-ball at a national level.
