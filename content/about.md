Hi, I'm Corentin, an AI Research Engineer with a focus on Reinforcement Learning, LLMs, and Software Engineering. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of human sciences, evolution, and AI.

I hold a Master's degree in Cognitive and Computer Sciences from [ENSC](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr) (GPA 4.0), complemented by exchange programs at [Laval University](https://www.ulaval.ca/) (Canada) and [ENSEIRB MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr), in AI and Data Science. I also interned at [Connectiv-IT](http://www.connectiv-it.com/) as a Data Scientist, and at [Inria](https://inria.fr/fr) between [Flowers](https://flowers.inria.fr/) and [Mnemosyne](https://team.inria.fr/mnemosyne/) teams, where I conducted research on the combination of Meta Reinforcement Learning, Reservoir Computing and Evolutionary Algorithms.

Currently, I'm a Research Engineer at Inria in the Flowers team, where I develop and study multi-agent systems. This involves building software and co-authoring papers, to study how texts generated by populations of LLMs evolve over time. Additionally, I develop a multi-agents simulator in Jax, for both research and teaching in AI. 

Among a lot of other things, I also love sport, and play volley-ball at a national level. [Our team](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FhwyMhKOxN7QKWM3JcCXx-rfS5ZLsxHw/view?usp=sharing) in Bordeaux placed 3rd in the 2023 French University Championship !
