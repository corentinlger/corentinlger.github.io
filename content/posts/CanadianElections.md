For my first Python and Machine Learning project, I worked on a Data Science assignment at Laval University. Our goal was to predict how Canadian citizens would vote in the 2019 elections.

We used real data and applied standard Machine Learning techniques, such as Random Forest, with the Scikit-Learn library. In the end, we achieved an accuracy of 80% on our test dataset.
