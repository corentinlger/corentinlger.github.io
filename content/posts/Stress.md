Even if we were studying mathematics and physics, we decided with a classmate to work on this neuroscience and psychology project, which examines the relationship between stress and addiction. The focus is on providing a concise and comprehensive understanding of how these two phenomena interact. The article (written in french) delves into the mechanisms of stress, followed by an exploration of addiction, and finally, synthesizes their interplay between both.
