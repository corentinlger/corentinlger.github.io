Minor open Source contributions on scientific python libraries such as [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).

Wrote a [turorial for parallelized hyper parameter search](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy/tree/master/tutorials/4.a-Hyperparameter%20search%20with%20Optuna) for another machine learning library called [ReservoirPy](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy).
