- Developed a [turorial for hyper parameter search](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy/tree/master/tutorials/4.a-Hyperparameter%20search%20with%20Optuna) using Optuna in the [ReservoirPy](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy) machine learning library. The tutorial covers sequential and parallelized hyperparameter search on local machines using the joblib package. It also demonstrates how to scale up this process by utilizing [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) files to parallelize the search on remote clusters of CPUs.

- Contributed to the [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) and [Stable-Baselines3-Contrib](https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines3-contrib) Reinforcement Learning Libraries by fixing several minor bugs.
