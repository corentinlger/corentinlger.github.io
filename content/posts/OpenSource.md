- Developed the [LLM-Culture](https://github.com/jeremyperez2/LLM-Culture) library. This software enables simulating networks composed of LLMs agents, that can generate text over multiple generations based on their neighbors input, personnality and task. 
The project also provides tools for analyzing the resulting text dynamics and offers an user-friendly web interface, making it accessible to non-programmers.

- Developed a [turorial for hyper parameter search](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy/tree/master/tutorials/4.a-Hyperparameter%20search%20with%20Optuna) using Optuna in the [ReservoirPy](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy) machine learning library. The tutorial covers sequential and parallelized hyperparameter search on local machines using the joblib package. It also demonstrates how to scale up this process by utilizing Slurm files to parallelize the search on remote clusters of CPUs.

- I helped creating this [Hugging Face space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/riiswa/RL-Interpretable-Policy-via-Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network) for [KanRL](https://github.com/riiswa/kanrl), a project studying the combination of Reinforcement Learning and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). I also led experiments to compare the performance of simple Policy Gradient and PPO algorithms using both KANs and MLPs.

- Fixed several issues on the [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) and [Stable-Baselines3-Contrib](https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines3-contrib) Reinforcement Learning Libraries.
