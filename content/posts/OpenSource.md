Minor open Source contributions on scientific python libraries such as [Stable-Baslines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) (Reinforcement Learning) or [Optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna) (Hyperparameter Search).

Wrote a [turorial for parallelized hyper parameter search](https://github.com/reservoirpy/reservoirpy/tree/master/tutorials/4.a-Hyperparameter%20search%20with%20Optuna) on another AI library : ReservoirPy.
