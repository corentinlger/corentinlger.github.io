Participated to an open source project called Ebiose during a 2 days [hackathon](https://hackatechbordeaux.inria.fr/), focusing on improving the performance of language based agents (made of a LLM and a prompt) on several tasks with a team of 4. We designed a system where multiple agents collaborate to solve a problem, and evolved their prompts thanks to an evolutionary algorithm to increase their efficiency.

Initial testing demonstrated promising results, with performance improvements reaching a factor of approximately 2 on a few mathematical questions.
