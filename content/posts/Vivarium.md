I am currently working on a project named **Vivarium** that serves both research and teaching in AI. It's a software that allows launching custom particle based multi-agents simulations, using a physics engine built in Jax. The simulations can be hosted on a server, and interacted with in real time from a web interface or Jupyter Notebooks. The Notebook case aims to teach students how to program behaviors of simulated robots with Python ! 

The code is still in development, but here is a an example of simulation that can be done at the moment:
