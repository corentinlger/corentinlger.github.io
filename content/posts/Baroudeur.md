This is a transdisciplinary project that ended up with the creation of a mobile application called “Baroudeurs”. The goal is to help people discover cities in a innovative manner. Indeed, Baroudeurs doesn't give you a particular itinerary to places or monuments, but it lets you discover a city and its misteries. The idea is to get inspiration from video games to develop the application, to create an experience based on discovery, curiosity the amazement to find a new places and learn its history.

We worked on the conception of the application with UX methods, and also programmed the back-end part of Baroudeurs. Another group was in charge of the coding of the apllication.
