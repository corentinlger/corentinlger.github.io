### Introduction 

I participated in the LeRobot Hackathon in Toulouse, organized by the Hugging Face team ðŸ¤— !  It was a great way to get my first steps into real-world reinforcement learning and robotics.

We went from having a very messy table (see below) with a lot of hardware parts to a fully assembled robot in a few hours. It was a robotic arm with a gripper, the Moss v1 and we tried to teach it how to manipulate a cube.

With friends, we then decided to chose the Reinforcement Learning track. To do so, we calibrated a first arm with another one we could controll manually, we set up a camera, and started creating a real world RL environment. It was a simple plate with a cube on it, and the goal was to push the cube to the other side of the plate. We recorded a dataset of 'expert' demonstrations (ours) with LeRobot library, and trained the arm with offline Reinforcement Learning using the TD-MPC algorithm. 

After this, we continued training the robot, but this time with online RL, whith the arm collecting trajectories itself in the real world ! 
We finally achieved an fun result, where our robot excelled in pushing the cube from right to left, but struggled to do a left-to-right motion.

This hands-on experience has sparked my interest for real-world robotics, motivated me to explore this in new projects. Thereâ€™s something mesmerizing about watching algorithms come to life in the real world. Thanks to all the collaborators on the project : Waris Radji, Anthony Kobanda, Mathieu Petitbois, ThÃ©o Michel and Mohamed Yassine Kabour, as well as all the LeRobot team for organizing this event !
