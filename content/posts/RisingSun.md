To try to beat friends on the combat phases of the "Rising Sun" board game, I created this simplified gymnasium implementation of the game. The project also incorporates a python script to train a single RL agent on the environment. This agent can currently only be trained against hard-coded players (either random of with heuristics).

The next step will be to add multi-agents training to the project. Then, it will be interesting to explore the path of self play to see how complex the behaviors of the agent can become !
