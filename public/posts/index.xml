    <description><![CDATA[With members of the Flowers team, we developed Vivarium, a multi-agent simulator in Jax. It serves both research and teaching in Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Life.
This software enables creating simple agents with two motors and two sensors, inspired by Braitenberg Vehicles, in a 2D rigid-body physics world (the physics engine is written in Jax-MD). Despite the simplicity of the agents at an individual level, the interactions between them can lead to complex emergent behaviors and scenarios !]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction I participated in the LeRobot Hackathon in Toulouse, organized by the Hugging Face team ü§ó ! It was a great way to get my first steps into real-world reinforcement learning and robotics.
We went from having a very messy table (see below) with a lot of hardware parts to a fully assembled robot in a few hours. It was a robotic arm with a gripper, the Moss v1 and we tried to teach it how to manipulate a cube.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What happens when LLMs play the Telephone game ‚òéÔ∏è? In this new preprint, we analyse the evolution of texts as they are transmitted between LLM agents ü§ñüí¨ü§ñüí¨ü§ñüí¨
Do text properties converge to attractors üß≤? How is this influenced by the tasküìù and model‚öôÔ∏è?
Abstract As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the next.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Co-developed the LLM-Culture library within the Flowers team. This software enables simulating networks composed of LLMs agents, that can generate text over multiple generations based on their neighbors input, personnality and task. The project also provides tools for analyzing the resulting text dynamics and offers an user-friendly web interface, making it accessible to non-programmers.
Developed a turorial for parallelized hyper parameter search using Optuna in the ReservoirPy machine learning library.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What can LLMs bring to the study of cultural evolution ü§î?
In this preprint, we present a framework for simulating cultural evolution using LLMs ü¶ú. We study how the dynamics depends on social structure, simulated personalitiesüë•, and whether it has potential attractorsüß≤üîç
Abstract Research in cultural evolution aims at providing causal explanations for the change of culture over time. Over the past decades, this field has generated an important body of knowledge, using experimental, historical, and computational methods.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[SimulationSandbox is a simple framework built with Jax and Socket that allows for real-time interaction between a simulation hosted on a server and multiple clients. It provides a simple interface for visualizing or interacting with the state of a hosted simulation from remote clients, such as jupyter notebooks.

    <title>Research: Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Paper presented at EvoStar 2024 (Long Talk).
Abstract Animals often demonstrate a remarkable ability to adapt to their environments during their lifetime. They do so partly due to the evolution of morphological and neural structures. These structures capture features of environments shared between generations to bias and speed up lifetime learning.
In this work, we propose a computational model for studying a mechanism that can enable such a process. We adopt a computational framework based on meta reinforcement learning as a model of the interplay between evolution and development.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction Participated to a project called Ebiose during a 2 days hackathon with a team of 4 people. It focuses on a multi-language-based-agent system to solve tasks. In this system, agents are composed of LLM (e.g. GPT-3.5) coupled with a specific prompt. The structure of the multi-agent system followes a predetermined sequence, where one agent answers a question, another verifies the answer, and a final agent synthesizes both responses. This collaboration is inspired by the Autogen Framework, emphasizing coordinated efforts among agents.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[To try to beat friends on the combat phases of the &ldquo;Rising Sun&rdquo; board game, I created this simplified gymnasium implementation of the game. The project also incorporates a python script to train a single RL agent on the environment. This agent can currently only be trained against hard-coded players (either random of with heuristics).
The next step will be to add multi-agents training to the project. Then, it will be interesting to explore the path of self play to see how complex the behaviors of the agent can become !]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[As a volleyball player who frequently travels to play against teams in distant cities, I became curious about how sports pools are optimized to ensure fair and reasonable travel times for teams in the same category. To explore this further and delve into evolutionary algorithms, I embarked on a project to create a custom genetic algorithm using NumPy.
The custom genetic algorithm is designed to improve the current distribution of cities in sports pools.]]></description>
