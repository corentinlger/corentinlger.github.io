    <description><![CDATA[Introduction I participated in the LeRobot Hackathon in Toulouse, organized by the Hugging Face team ðŸ¤— ! It was a great way to get my first steps into real-world reinforcement learning and robotics.
We went from having a very messy table (see below) with a lot of hardware parts to a fully assembled robot in a few hours. It was a robotic arm with a gripper, the Moss v1 and we tried to teach it how to manipulate a cube.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction Participated to a project called Ebiose during a 2 days hackathon with a team of 4 people. It focuses on a multi-language-based-agent system to solve tasks. In this system, agents are composed of LLM (e.g. GPT-3.5) coupled with a specific prompt. The structure of the multi-agent system followes a predetermined sequence, where one agent answers a question, another verifies the answer, and a final agent synthesizes both responses. This collaboration is inspired by the Autogen Framework, emphasizing coordinated efforts among agents.]]></description>
