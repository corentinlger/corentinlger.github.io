      <description>Being a volleyball player and taking the road several times a month, to play against other teams in distant cities, I wondered how sport pools are optimized in order to have a reasonable travel time between the teams of a same pool. To understand better, I tried to create my own genetic algorithm to optimize those kind of problems. After creating a dataset with all the cities in National 3 league in France, and obtained their GPS coordinates with a python package.</description>

      <title>Alzheimer disease detection by 3D MRI analysis </title>
      <link>https://corentinlger.github.io/post/alzheimer/</link>

      <description>This project focuses on medical imaging and computer vision. The goal is to develop a machine learning model able to detect the state of development of the Alzheimer disease, using 3D MRI data from patients. In order to do so, we tried different approaches, including the &amp;lsquo;2D epsilon&amp;rsquo; method, which is the use of 2D Convolutionnal neural networks on 2D slices of the MRI, and also the direct use of 3D CNN.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Reinforcement learning - Research project with Inria</title>

      <description>Modeling complex problems is a real issue in Reinforcement learning. The goal of this projet is to use a RL model, such as Q-learning, on symbolic data, where the knowledge of the problem would be stored, in the form of qualitative or numerical data (in JSON for example). Instead of only working with numerical data, we could link the data with a certain &amp;rsquo;edition distance&amp;rsquo; which permits to evaluate the proximity of 2 elements.</description>

      <description>This data science project aims to identify what emotion a person is feeling on a picture. Here, we especially focus on depressed or happy people. In order to do so, pictures were downloaded from the web thanks to a data pipeline and have then been pre-processed. Then, a deep learning model has been created with Tensorflow in order to classify emotions of people. The model has finally been evaluated, and tested on other random images and gave excellent results.</description>

      <description>This is a kaggle data science project wich aims to discover who was in the &amp;lsquo;Spaceship Titanic&amp;rsquo;, an interstellar passenger liner. We used an ensemble learning algorithm to achieve this goal : a random forest. After a step of pre-processing with missing values prediction (with a KNN algotithm for numerical values), our machine learning model was able to identify wether a person was in the ship or not with an accuracy of about 80%.</description>

      <description>This 4 months internship was my firt professional experience in data science. My mission was to work on the optimization of the maintenance of an aircraft fleet. I realized several data science tasks such as data processing and visualization, but also statistical analysis and clustering thanks to unsupervised learning. Two models of outlier detection and missing value simulation were also created, as well as a theoretical linear programming optimization model.</description>

      <description>This is the first data science project I ever made, during my scholarship in Canada. The goal of this project is to predict the vote of canadian citizens during the 2019 election, thanks to responses to a survey. Despite the fact that we were beginners in this field,we managed with my classmate to predict about 80% of those votes right.

      <title>Design of a mobile application &#39;Baroudeurs&#39;</title>

      <description>This is a transdisciplinary project that ended up with the creation of a mobile application called “Baroudeurs”. The goal is to help people discover cities in a innovative manner. Indeed, Baroudeurs doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you a particular itinerary to places or monuments, but it lets you discover a city and its misteries. The idea is to get inspiration from video games to devellop the application, to create an experience based on discovery, curiosity the amazement to find a new places and learn its history.</description>

      <description>This UX project was realized with 5 other classmates in Canada. We had to create a brand new human machine interface for an ice cream shop and answer to specific needs. In order to do so, we had to contact potential customers but also people working in this fiel, and interview them based on UX methods. When we fully understood the needs of the future interface users, we started to create wireframes.</description>

      <description>I am a 22 years old student who is passionate about human, science and sport! After high-school, I studied two years in a preparatory class in Bordeaux (CPBx), in sport study program in volley-ball. I currently play at a national level in Talence. Next, I joined an engineering school named ENSC (Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Cognitique). Cognitique is a french word designating the association between cognitive and computer sciences. This concept includes artificial intelligence, human-machine interaction, user experience (UX), but also other fields of human and social sciences (human factor, neurosciences, psychology&amp;hellip;).</description>
