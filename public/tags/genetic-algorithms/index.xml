      <description>Being a volleyball player and taking the road several times a month, to play against other teams in distant cities, I wondered how sport pools are optimized in order to have a reasonable travel time between the teams of a same pool. To understand better, I tried to create my own genetic algorithm to optimize those kind of problems. After creating a dataset with all the cities in National 3 league in France, and obtained their GPS coordinates with a python package.</description>
