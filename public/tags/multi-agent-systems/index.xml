    <description><![CDATA[I am currently working on a project named Vivarium that serves both research and teaching in AI. It&rsquo;s a software that allows launching custom particle based multi-agents simulations, using a physics engine built in Jax. The simulations can be hosted on a server, and interacted with in real time from a web interface or Jupyter Notebooks. The Notebook case aims to teach students how to program behaviors of simulated robots with Python !]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What can LLMs bring to the study of cultural evolution ü§î?
In this preprint, we present a framework for simulating cultural evolution using LLMs ü¶ú. We study how the dynamics depends on social structure, simulated personalitiesüë•, and whether it has potential attractorsüß≤üîç
Abstract Research in cultural evolution aims at providing causal explanations for the change of culture over time. Over the past decades, this field has generated an important body of knowledge, using experimental, historical, and computational methods.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[SimulationSandbox is a simple framework built with Jax and Socket that allows for real-time interaction between a simulation hosted on a server and multiple clients. It provides a simple interface for visualizing or interacting with the state of a hosted simulation from remote clients, such as jupyter notebooks.

    <title>Hackathon: Ebiose</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction Participated to a project called Ebiose during a 2 days hackathon with a team of 4 people. It focuses on a multi-language-based-agent system to solve tasks. In this system, agents are composed of LLM (e.g. GPT-3.5) coupled with a specific prompt. The structure of the multi-agent system followes a predetermined sequence, where one agent answers a question, another verifies the answer, and a final agent synthesizes both responses. This collaboration is inspired by the Autogen Framework, emphasizing coordinated efforts among agents.]]></description>
