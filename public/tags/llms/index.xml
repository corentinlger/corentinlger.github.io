    <description><![CDATA[Arxiv preprint (Under Review)
Abstract As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors, existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases, negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor states.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Arxiv preprint. We are currently working on the paper to submit it to a conference.
Abstract Research in cultural evolution aims at providing causal explanations for the change of culture over time. Over the past decades, this field has generated an important body of knowledge, using experimental, historical, and computational methods. While computational models have been very successful at generating testable hypotheses about the effects of several factors, such as population structure or transmission biases, some phenomena have so far been more complex to capture using agent-based and formal models.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction Participated to a project called Ebiose during a 2 days hackathon with a team of 4 people. It focuses on a multi-language-based-agent system to solve tasks. In this system, agents are composed of LLM (e.g. GPT-3.5) coupled with a specific prompt. The structure of the multi-agent system followes a predetermined sequence, where one agent answers a question, another verifies the answer, and a final agent synthesizes both responses. This collaboration is inspired by the Autogen Framework, emphasizing coordinated efforts among agents.]]></description>
