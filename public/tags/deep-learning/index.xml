    <description><![CDATA[Co-developed the LLM-Culture library within the Flowers team. This software enables simulating networks composed of LLMs agents, that can generate text over multiple generations based on their neighbors input, personnality and task. The project also provides tools for analyzing the resulting text dynamics and offers an user-friendly web interface, making it accessible to non-programmers.
Developed a turorial for parallelized hyper parameter search using Optuna in the ReservoirPy machine learning library.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Paper presented at EvoStar 2024 (Long Talk).
Abstract Animals often demonstrate a remarkable ability to adapt to their environments during their lifetime. They do so partly due to the evolution of morphological and neural structures. These structures capture features of environments shared between generations to bias and speed up lifetime learning.
In this work, we propose a computational model for studying a mechanism that can enable such a process. We adopt a computational framework based on meta reinforcement learning as a model of the interplay between evolution and development.]]></description>
