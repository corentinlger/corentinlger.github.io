      <description>A data science project that aims to identify if a person on a picture is depressed or happy. In order to do so, a data pipeline has been created and the learning has been made thanks to a convolutionnal neural network.

      <description>This is my first internship in data science for Connectiv-IT. My mission was to work on the optimization of the maintenance of an aircraft fleet. I realized several data science tasks such as data processing and visualization, but also statistical analysis and clustering thanks to unsupervised learning. Two models of outlier detection and missing value simulation were also created, as well as a theoretical linear programming optimization model.</description>

      <description>This is the first big data (and data science) project I ever made, during my scholarship in Canada. The goal of this project is to predict the vote of canadian citizens during the 2019 election, thanks to responses to a survey. Despite the fact that we were beginners in this field,we managed with my classmate to predict about 80% of those votes right. Link to Github repository</description>
