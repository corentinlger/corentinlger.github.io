    <description><![CDATA[Developed the LLM-Culture library. This software enables simulating networks composed of LLMs agents, that can generate text over multiple generations based on their neighbors input, personnality and task. The project also provides tools for analyzing the resulting text dynamics and offers an user-friendly web interface, making it accessible to non-programmers.
Developed a turorial for hyper parameter search using Optuna in the ReservoirPy machine learning library. The tutorial covers sequential and parallelized hyperparameter search on local machines using the joblib package.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction Participated to a project called Ebiose during a 2 days hackathon with a team of 4 people. It focuses on a multi-language-based-agent system to solve tasks. In this system, agents are composed of LLM (e.g. GPT-3.5) coupled with a specific prompt. The structure of the multi-agent system followes a predetermined sequence, where one agent answers a question, another verifies the answer, and a final agent synthesizes both responses. This collaboration is inspired by the Autogen Framework, emphasizing coordinated efforts among agents.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[For my first Python and Machine Learning project, I worked on a Data Science assignment at Laval University. Our goal was to predict how Canadian citizens would vote in the 2019 elections.
We used real data and applied standard Machine Learning techniques, such as Random Forest, with the Scikit-Learn library. In the end, we achieved an accuracy of 80% on our test dataset.]]></description>
